## STRUCTURE: Problem → Solution → Impact

### ACT 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Caroling group looking unsure, scattered planning notes]**

**NARRATION:**
"Christmas caroling is a cherished tradition—but it's chaotic to organize. How do you pick songs? How do you know if singers can hit the notes? What's the cultural history? And if you're a small group, how do you arrange parts?"

**[Visual: Clips of confusion, song sheets, people checking phones]**

"Groups spend hours on spreadsheets, email threads, and YouTube lookups."

### ACT 2: The Solution (90 seconds)

**[Visual: App opens to home screen]**

**NARRATION:**
"Carolers solves this with AI-powered carol expertise."

#### SCENE 1: Intelligent Song Selection
**[Visual: Create event → Select song]**

"Create an event, add songs. Our Gemini 3-powered recommendation engine suggests perfect choices based on your group's skill level and theme."

**[Visual: Setlist shows "Recommended for your group"]**

"It understands musical complexity, cultural significance, and harmony requirements."

#### SCENE 2: Deep Carol Analysis (THE KEY MOMENT)
**[Visual: Open lyrics modal → Click "AI Insights" tab]**

**NARRATION (slower, emphasizing innovation):**
"Click any carol to see AI Insights. This is where Gemini 3's extended thinking shines."

**[Visual: Deep Analysis Panel appears with four buttons]**

"Four analysis types. Let me show you."

**[Click "Musical Structure"]**
**[Loading spinner, then results appear with "Show Reasoning" button]**

"Gemini 3 performs deep reasoning on the composition. Click 'Show Reasoning' to see the model's internal thinking process."

**[Click "Show Reasoning" button]**
**[Thinking process expands, showing internal reasoning]**

**NARRATION:**
"This is Gemini 3's extended thinking at work. The model reasons through harmonic structure, melodic arc, vocal requirements—providing analysis a musicologist would give."

**[Visual: Analysis text visible]**

"No other model does this. No GPT-4. No Claude. Just Gemini 3's native reasoning capability."

**[Click another analysis type, e.g., "Performance Guide"]**
**[Results show with specific vocal range, difficulty level, tips]**

**NARRATION:**
"Performance guides tell singers exactly what they're getting into. Vocal range, technical difficulty, ensemble tips. Everything derived from reasoning, not templates."

**[Click "Cultural Context"]**
**[Show historical origin, cultural traditions]**

"Cultural context tells the story of the carol—why it matters, where it comes from, how it's performed around the world."

#### SCENE 3: Multimodal Vision (Foundation)
**[Visual: Return to main view, show hypothetical image upload]**

**NARRATION:**
"We're also building vision analysis. Upload sheet music, and Gemini 3's superior vision (81% on MMMU-Pro benchmarks) reads notation, identifies voice parts, and suggests arrangements."

**[Visual: Mockup or technical diagram of vision flow]**

"Sheet music → Notation analysis → Arrangement suggestions. Multimodal reasoning at its finest."

#### SCENE 4: Community & Performance
**[Visual: Event page with singers, voting, chat]**

**NARRATION:**
"Singers vote on songs, coordinate contributions, chat about performance. After the event—"

**[Visual: Recap page with stats]**

"—celebrate with stats and recap the magic of the night."

### ACT 3: Impact (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Montage of diverse caroling groups using the app]**

**NARRATION:**
"Carolers transforms how groups prepare. No more confusion. No more "Can I sing this?" You have expert guidance, backed by Gemini 3's reasoning."

**[Visual: Return to app, showing completed event]**

"For caroling groups, retirement communities, churches, holiday events—anyone singing together—Carolers is the essential tool."

**[Visual: App logo, call-to-action]**

**FINAL TEXT ON SCREEN:**
"Carolers: AI-Powered Carol Planning

**NARRATION:**
"Visit [URL] to experience it yourself."

## TECHNICAL TALKING POINTS (If asked)

### Why Gemini 3?
- **Extended thinking** native to all models (unlike OpenAI's o1)
- **Superior multimodal** (81% on MMMU-Pro vs 76% for competitors)
- **Cost-effective** ($0.50/$3 vs $5/$15 for competitors)
- **Best reasoning** (93.8% on GPQA Diamond)

### Implementation Highlights
- `thinking_level: 'high'` for complex analysis
- `media_resolution: 'HIGH'` for notation detail
- Graceful fallback if thinking unavailable
- Concise prompting (per Gemini 3 best practices)

### Judges' Perspective
✅ **Working demo** (not just slides)
✅ **Solves real problem** (carol groups are real)
✅ **Meaningful tech integration** (reasoning, not just "AI-powered")
✅ **Competitive advantage** (only Gemini 3 has this)
✅ **Professional polish** (UI/UX is clean)

- Show thinking process clearly (readers need to see it)
- Smooth transitions between scenes

### Audio
- Clear narration (professional tone, not overly energetic)
- Subtle background music (festive but not cheesy)
- Use app interaction sounds (button clicks, loads)

### Captions
- "Gemini 3 Extended Thinking" (when revealing thinking)
- "PhD-Level Reasoning" (when showing analysis depth)
- "Only Gemini 3" (competitive positioning)
- App URL prominently at end
